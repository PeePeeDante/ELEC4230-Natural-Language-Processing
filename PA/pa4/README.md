I trained my rnn on colab notebook.

To run my code, upload "dataloader.py", "preprocess.py", "train.txt", "valid.txt" and "test.txt" to the same directory of the colab notebook. Please upload the data files that contain less data. In particular, those data files under "data", not those under "data/micro". Thank you!

The URL of my colab notebook is as follows.

I didn't write "statistics.py", since a "statistic" dictionary will be returned by "build_vocab()" function in "dataloader.py".
